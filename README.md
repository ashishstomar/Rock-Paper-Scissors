# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a fun implementation of the grade-school classic "rock paper scissors" game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a user interface.


How to Play:

Open the deployed website or index.html file in your web browser.

Click on one of the buttons to choose your move: rock, paper, or scissors.

The computer will randomly select its move.

The winner of each round will be determined according to the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.

The first player to reach 5 points wins the game!

Enjoy playing and may the odds be ever in your favor!
